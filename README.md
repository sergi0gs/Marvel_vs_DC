# Introduction

In this project we will try to analyse the information about the heroes of Marvel and DC comics ü§© learning about the different types of techniques that we have in Python to analyse, clean, transform and visualize data üìä

The information comes from these datasets in kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/complete-superhero-dataset, 
https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set

Which was constructed using web scrapping tecniques from the next website üëá: 
https://www.superherodb.com/.

Alse we use as a guide the next example maked in R from üëá: 
https://cosmoduende.medium.com/dc-comics-vs-marvel-comics-an%C3%A1lisis-exploratorio-y-visualizaci%C3%B3n-de-datos-con-r-b0cf565e44e2

# Resources
We are going to use the next 3 datasets üëá:
1. [SuperHero.csv](https://github.com/sergi0gs/Marvel_vs_DC/blob/main/datasets/SuperheroDataset.csv)
2. [heroes_information.csv](https://github.com/sergi0gs/Marvel_vs_DC/blob/main/datasets/heroes_information.csv)
3. [super_hero_powers.csv](https://github.com/sergi0gs/Marvel_vs_DC/blob/main/datasets/super_hero_powers.csv)

# Data Exploratory
### Import libraries
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline

```
--------------------------------------------------------

### Read files
In this case we are going to use the raw version of github.
```
superhero = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergi0gs/Marvel_vs_DC/main/datasets/SuperheroDataset.csv')
heroes_information = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergi0gs/Marvel_vs_DC/main/datasets/heroes_information.csv')
super_hero_powers = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/sergi0gs/Marvel_vs_DC/blob/main/datasets/super_hero_powers.csv')
```
--------------------------------------------------------

### Data shape
##### SuperHero.csv
```
superhero.shape
```
--------------------------------------------------------

![superhero_shape](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71573671/112911245-9dc23780-90ba-11eb-9091-b8f43e1de6e1.PNG)

##### heroes_information_csv
```
heroes_information.shape
```
--------------------------------------------------------

![heroes_information_shape](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71573671/112911418-fe517480-90ba-11eb-8fc2-9252b53a4d25.PNG)


##### Super_hero_powers.csv
```
super_hero_powers.shape
```
--------------------------------------------------------

![super_hero_powers_shape](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71573671/112911460-13c69e80-90bb-11eb-8f3c-5c2ffc06c283.PNG)


### Information
##### SuperHero.csv
```
superhero.info()
```
--------------------------------------------------------

![superhero_info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71573671/112911953-11187900-90bc-11eb-8403-20dc4fc3d5b9.png)

üëÄ We see that "Skin color" have very little information. It's important notice that because we are going to do something with it later.

Visualize 5 random rows
```
superhero.sample(5)
```

![superhero_sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71573671/113387005-09bdcd80-9351-11eb-9dd9-25f313675e15.png)

--------------------------------------------------------

üëÄ We can see that there are some columns that we probably we are not going to use so we must remember this information to use it later. Also we can not see all the columns because there are a lot of its.

##### heroes_information_csv
```
heroes_information.info()
```

![heroes_information_info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71573671/113387386-d891cd00-9351-11eb-91aa-f705c5c752a8.PNG)

It is OkeyüëÜ.

Visualize 5 random rows üëá

```
heroes_information.sample(5)
```

![heroes_information_sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71573671/113387554-260e3a00-9352-11eb-9d5b-02d0215f2aaf.PNG)

It is OkeyüëÜ.

--------------------------------------------------------

##### Super_hero_powers.csv
```
super_hero_powers.info()
```

![super_hero_powers_info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71573671/113387724-7c7b7880-9352-11eb-8dc6-d76ff8c02cd7.PNG)

Notice that we cannot see the information about it because it have a lot of columns so we are going to see 5 rows of it to understand it better
```
super_hero_powers.sample(5)
```

![super_hero_powers_sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71573671/113388110-3a9f0200-9353-11eb-919b-ce6fa17eb71a.PNG)

üëÄ We can see that there are 168 columns. This is the reasons why we cannot see it so probably we are going to transform it in a long data format to solve it later.
