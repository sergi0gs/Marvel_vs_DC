# Introduction

In this project we will try to analyse the information about the heroes of Marvel and DC comics learning about the different types of techniques that we have in Python to analyse, clean, transform and visualize data.

The information comes from these datasets in kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/complete-superhero-dataset, 
https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set

Which was constructed using web scrapping tecniques from the next website: https://www.superherodb.com/.

Alse we use as a guide the next example maked in R from: https://cosmoduende.medium.com/dc-comics-vs-marvel-comics-an%C3%A1lisis-exploratorio-y-visualizaci%C3%B3n-de-datos-con-r-b0cf565e44e2
