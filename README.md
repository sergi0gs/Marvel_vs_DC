# Introduction


In this project we will try to analyse the information about the heroes of Marvel and DC comics learning about the different types of techniques that we have in Python to analyse, clean, transform and visualize data.

The information comes from these datasets in kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/complete-superhero-dataset, 
https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set

Which was constructed using web scrapping tecniques from the next website: https://www.superherodb.com/.

Alse we use as a guide the next example maked in R from: https://cosmoduende.medium.com/dc-comics-vs-marvel-comics-an%C3%A1lisis-exploratorio-y-visualizaci%C3%B3n-de-datos-con-r-b0cf565e44e2

# Data Exploratory
### Import libraries

### Read files
In this case we are going to use the raw version of github.

### Data shape

### Print information about the dataframes

We see in this example that there are too many columns so later we will change it to a long format.
